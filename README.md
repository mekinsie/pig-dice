# _Pig Dice_

#### _A fun game to play with friends_

#### By _**Ash Porter (KirbyPaint)**_
#### Co-authored by _**Mekinsie Callahan**_

## Description

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":<br>
* If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.<br>
* If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.<br>
* If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.<br><br>
The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
